# Train a Quadcopter to fly
In this project, an agent that can fly a quadcopter using a reinforcement learning algorithm is trained. 

## Project Overview
The goal of this project is to train an quadcopter how to fly autonomously using reinforcement learning algorithms. Given a task, the agent learns to perform it without any help.

This project is based on the [Machine Learning Engineer Udacity Course](https://eu.udacity.com/course/machine-learning-engineer-nanodegree--nd009).

## Project Highlights
This project is designed to give a hands-on experience with Reinforcement Learning (RL) and how to build an agent that can fly a quadcopter. 

Subjects learned by completing the project:

	Dynamic Programming
	Monte Carlo Methods
	Temporal-Difference Methods
	RL in continuous space
	Deep Q-Learning
	Policy Gradients
	Actor-Critic Methods
